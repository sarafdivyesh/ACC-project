98 35 350 none of these. show answer workspace answer: d explanation: aptitude simplification test paper 1 aptitude simplification test paper 2 aptitude simplification test paper 3 simplification concepts 27) stocks and shares aptitude 1) what is the market price of a 9% share when a person gets 180 by investing rs. 4000? 150 200 250 300 show answer workspace answer: b explanation: let the face value of the share = rs. 100 dividend per share = 9 as per the question, an income of rs. 180 is obtained from an investment of rs. 4000. so, an income of rs. 9 is obtained from an investment of rs. = (4000/180) * 9 = 200 so, the market price of the share = rs. 200 aptitude stocks and shares test paper 1 aptitude stocks and shares test paper 2 aptitude stocks and shares test paper 3 aptitude stocks and shares test paper 4 stocks and shares concepts 28) chain rule aptitude 1) if 15 men can reap the crops of a field in 28 days, in how many days will 5 men reap it? 50 days 60 days 84 days 9.333 days show answer workspace answer: c explanation: let 5 men can reap a field in x days so, put the same quantities on the same side. men: days now, men and days are inversely proportional to each other. if we increase the number of men fewer days will be required to complete the work. inversely proportional means i.e., 5: 15 = 28: x or, x = (28*15)/ 5 or, x = 84 days hence, 5 men can reap a field in 84 days. aptitude chain rule test paper 1 aptitude chain rule test paper 2 aptitude chain rule test paper 3 chain rule concepts 29) true discount and banker's discount aptitude 1) the true discount on a bill of rs. 2700 is rs. 200. what is the banker's discount? rs. 210 rs. 212 rs. 216 rs. 218 show answer workspace answer: c explanation: face value = rs. 2700 td = rs. 200 pw (present worth) = fv (face value) - td (true discount)                                 = 2700 ? 200 = rs. 2500 true discount is the simple interest on the present value for the unexpired time. now, simple interest on rs. 2500 for unexpired time = rs. 200 the rate of simple interest banker's discount is the simple interest on the face value of the bill for unexpired time, i.e., simple interest on rs. 2700 for unexpired time or remaining time. r = 8% banker's discount aptitude true discount and banker's discount test paper 1 aptitude true discount and banker's discount test paper 2 aptitude true discount and banker's discount test paper 3 true discount and banker's discount concepts 30) logarithm aptitude 1) find the logarithm of 1/256 to the base 2?2. 16 13/5 -16/3 12 show answer workspace answer: c explanation: let log2?2 [1/256] = x we know that loga y = x is similar to ax = y so, we can write it as [1/256] = (2?2) x or, (2?2) x = [1/28] or, [21 * 21/2]x = 1/28 or, 23x/2 = 2-8 therefore, 3x/2 = -8 hence, x = (-8 * 2)/ 3 = -16/3 aptitude logarithm test paper 1 aptitude logarithm test paper 2 aptitude logarithm test paper 3 aptitude logarithm test paper 4 logarithm concepts 31) square roots and cube roots aptitude 1) = 80 3.74 149.67 196 225 show answer workspace answer: c explanation: = 80 ? ?=142= 14 ? 14 = 196 aptitude square roots and cube roots test paper 1 aptitude square roots and cube roots test paper 2 aptitude square roots and cube roots test paper 3 aptitude square roots and cube roots test paper 4 square roots and cube roots concepts 32) problems on numbers aptitude 1) if 30% of a certain number is 12.6, what is the number? 24 42 23 32 show answer workspace answer: b explanation: let the required number be x. so, according to the question: aptitude problems on numbers test paper 1 aptitude problems on numbers test paper 2 aptitude problems on numbers test paper 3 aptitude problems on numbers test paper 4 problems on numbers concepts 33) odd man out and series aptitude 1) complete the series 2, 5, 9, 19, 37....... 76 74 75 none of these. show answer workspace answer: c explanation: the second number is one more than twice the first, 2 x 2 +1 = 5 the third number is one less than twice the second, 5 x 2 -1 = 9 the fourth number is one more than twice the third, 9 x 2 +1 = 19 the fifth number is one less than twice the fourth. 19 x 2 - 1 = 37 therefore, the sixth number is one more than twice the fifth. so, the missing number: 37 x 2 + 1 = 75. aptitude odd man out and series test paper 1 aptitude odd man out and series test paper 2 aptitude odd man out and series test paper 3 odd man out and series concepts 34) algebraic expressions aptitude 1) if x2+= 34,x+is equal to 3 4 5 none of these show answer workspace answer: d explanation: adding 2 to the l.h.s and r.h.s of the equation: x2+2+=34+2[?(a+b)2=a2+b2+2ab] (x+)2= 36 (x+)= +6,-6 aptitude algebraic expressions test paper 1 aptitude algebraic expressions test paper 2 aptitude algebraic expressions test paper 3 aptitude algebraic expressions test paper 4 algebraic expressions concepts 35) permutation and combination aptitude 1) in what ways the letters of the word "rumour" can be arranged? 180 150 200 230 show answer workspace answer: d answer with the explanation: the word rumour consists of 6 words in which r and u are repeated twice. therefore, the required number of permutations = or, = 180 hence, 180 words can be formed by arranging the word rumour. permutation and combination test paper 1 permutation and combination test paper 2 permutation and combination concepts next ?
