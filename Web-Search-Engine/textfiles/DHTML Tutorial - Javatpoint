</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write("javatpoint");
</script>
</body>
</html>
 test it now output: javascript and html event a javascript code can also be executed when some event occurs. suppose, a user clicks an html element on a webpage, and after clicking, the javascript function associated with that html element is automatically invoked. and, then the statements in the function are performed. example 1: the following example shows the current date and time with the javascript and html event (onclick). in this example, we type the javascript code in the <head> tag. 
<html>
<head>
<title>
dhtml with javascript
</title>
<script type="text/javascript">
function dateandtime()
{
alert(date());
}
</script>
</head>
<body bgcolor="orange">
<font size="4" color="blue">
<center> <p>
click here # <a href="#" onclick="dateandtime();"> date and time </a>
# to check the today's date and time. 
</p> </center>
</font>
</body>
</html>
 test it now output: explanation: in the above code, we displayed the current date and time with the help of javascript in dhtml. in the body tag, we used the anchor tag, which refers to the page itself. when you click on the link, then the function of javascript is called. in the javascript function, we use the alert() method in which we type the date() function. the date function shows the date and time in the alert dialog box on the web page. javascript and html dom with version 4 of html, javascript code can also change the inner content and attributes of the html event. example 1: this example checks the grade of a student according to the percentage criteria with the javascript and html dom. in this example, we type the code of a javascript in the <body> tag. 
<html> 
    <head> 
        <title> check student grade
</title> 
    </head> 
      
    <body> 
<p>enter the percentage of a student:</p> 
<input type="text" id="percentage">
<button type="button" onclick="checkgrade()">
find grade
</button> 
<p id="demo"></p>
<script type="text/javascript">  
            function checkgrade() { 
                var x,p, text; 
                p = document.getelementbyid("percentage").value; 
		
		x=parseint(p);
		
		
               if (x>90 && x <= 100) { 
                    document.getelementbyid("demo").innerhtml = "a1";
                } else if (x>80 && x <= 90) { 
                   document.getelementbyid("demo").innerhtml = "a2";
		 } else if (x>70 && x <= 80) { 
                   document.getelementbyid("demo").innerhtml = "a3";
		}	
            } 
        </script> 
    </body> 
</html> 
 test it now output: explanation: in the above code, we check the student’s grade with the help of javascript in dhtml. in the javascript code, we used the checkgrade() method, which is invoked when we click on the button. in this function, we stored the value in variable p. the value is taken in the input field. when the value is stored, then we convert the value of p into integer and store the conversion value in x, because the value in p is text. after that, we used the if-else-if statement for finding the grade according to the percentage. css with javascript in dhtml with version 4 of html, javascript code can also change the style such as size, color, and face of an html element. example 1: the following example changes the color of a text. 
<html>
<head>
  <title>
getelementbyid.style.property example
</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="demo"> this text changes color when click on the following different buttons. </p>
  <button onclick="change_color('green');"> green </button>
  <button onclick="change_color('blue');"> blue </button>
<script type="text/javascript">

function change_color(newcolor) {
  var element = document.getelementbyid('demo').style.color = newcolor;
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
 test it now output: explanation: in the above code, we changed the color of a text by using the following syntax: 
document.getelementbyid('demo').style.property=new_value;. 
 the above syntax is used in the javascript function, which is performed or called when we clicked on the html buttons. the different html buttons specify the color of a text. dhtml css we can easily use the css with the dhtml page with the help of javascript and html dom. with the help of this.style.property=new style statement, we can change the style of the currently used html element. or, we can also update the style of any particular html element by document.getelementbyid(id).style.property = new_style statement. example 1: the following example uses the dhtml css for changing the style of current element: 
<html>
<head>
<title>
changes current html element
</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h1 onclick="this.style.color='blue'"> this is a javatpoint site </h1>
<center>
</body>
</html>
 test it now output: explanation: in the above code, we used the this.style.color='blue' statement, which shows the color of a text as blue. example 2: the following example uses the dhtml css for changing the style of the html element: 
<html>
<head>
  <title>
changes the particular html element example
</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="demo"> this text changes color when click on the following different buttons. </p>
  <button onclick="change_color('green');"> green </button>
  <button onclick="change_color('blue');"> blue </button>
<script type="text/javascript">

function change_color(newcolor) {
  var element = document.getelementbyid('demo').style.color = newcolor;
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
 test it now output: explanation: in the above code, we used the var element = document.getelementbyid('demo').style.color = newcolor; statement, which changes the color of a text as green and blue according to the buttons. dhtml events an event is defined as changing the occurrence of an object. it is compulsory to add the events in the dhtml page. without events, there will be no dynamic content on the html page. the event is a term in the html, which triggers the actions in the web browsers. suppose, any user clicks an html element, then the javascript code associated with that element is executed. actually, the event handlers catch the events performed by the user and then execute the code. example of events: click a button. submitting a form. an image loading or a web page loading, etc. following table describes the event handlers used in the dhtml: s.no. event when it occurs 1. onabort it occurs when the user aborts the page or media file loading. 2. onblur it occurs when the user leaves an html object. 3. onchange it occurs when the user changes or updates the value of an object. 4. onclick it occurs or triggers when any user clicks on an html element. 5. ondblclick it occurs when the user clicks on an html element two times together. 6. onfocus it occurs when the user focuses on an html element. this event handler works opposite to onblur. 7. onkeydown it triggers when a user is pressing a key on a keyboard device. this event handler works for all the keys. 8. onkeypress it triggers when the users press a key on a keyboard. this event handler is not triggered for all the keys. 9. onkeyup it occurs when a user released a key from a keyboard after pressing on an object or element. 10. onload it occurs when an object is completely loaded. 11. onmousedown it occurs when a user presses the button of a mouse over an html element. 12. onmousemove it occurs when a user moves the cursor on an html object. 13. onmouseover it occurs when a user moves the cursor over an html object. 14. onmouseout it occurs or triggers when the mouse pointer is moved out of an html element. 15. onmouseup it occurs or triggers when the mouse button is released over an html element. 16. onreset it is used by the user to reset the form. 17. onselect it occurs after selecting the content or text on a web page. 18. onsubmit it is triggered when the user clicks a button after the submission of a form. 19. onunload it is triggered when the user closes a web page. following are the different examples using the different event handlers, which helps us to understand the concept of dhtml events: example 1: this example uses the onclick event handler, which is used to change the text after clicking. 
<html>
<head>
